```

### Adding New Features

1. **New API Endpoints**: Add to `main.py` with proper error handling
2. **Database Models**: Add to `models.py` and run migrations
3. **External Integrations**: Add to appropriate module with error handling
4. **AI Features**: Integrate with Gemini or other AI services

### Testing

```bash
# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Test loan file creation
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/loan-files \
  -F "borrower=John Doe" \
  -F "broker=Jane Smith" \
  -F "loan_type=conventional" \
  -F "amount=500000"

# Test rate optimization
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/rates/optimize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"loan_amount": 500000, "credit_score": 720, "ltv": 80}'
```

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/credentials.json
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
ENVIRONMENT=production
```

### Using Gunicorn
```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn main:app -w 4 -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Using Docker
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app", "-w", "4", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

## Integration with Frontend

The backend is designed to work with the React frontend (`frontend-broker`). Key integration points:

- **CORS**: Configured for localhost:3000 and localhost:5173
- **File Uploads**: Multipart form data support
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support planned
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth planned

## Monitoring & Logging

- **Logging**: Configured with INFO level logging
- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Performance**: Background tasks for heavy operations

## Roadmap

- [ ] JWT authentication and authorization
- [ ] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [ ] Advanced rate optimization algorithms
- [ ] Multi-broker support
- [ ] Advanced admin dashboard
- [ ] Production deployment automation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] API rate limiting and caching

## Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check the API documentation at `/docs`
2. Review the logs for error details
3. Test individual endpoints for specific issues
4. Check environment variable configuration
